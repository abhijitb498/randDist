AUTHOR, ABHIJIT BAISHYA

gfortran compiler is needed.

To run the smaple main program run "make" in the terminal; an executable "rand" will be created, otherwise barring the rand.f90 file other files are necessary as the module rand needs nrtype.f90, nrutil.f90 and spline_mod.f90 .

The sample probability distribution function is given in xs_dist.txt file.
